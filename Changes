Version 0.9.1 | The wee hours of December 19th, 2011 | 5506598358

    API Changes/Compatibility Information:
     * ::BEP03::build_piece(...) wants the actual data rather than a reference
     * { error => $msg } is returned when parsing bad packet data

         which makes things easy for vec()

         - This distribution is my first step toward breaking Net::BitTorrent
             up into manageable parts. Next comes AnyEvent::DHT or
             AnyEvent::BitTorrent::DHT... I haven't decided on a namespace.
