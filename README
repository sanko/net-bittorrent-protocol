NAME
    Net::BitTorrent::Protocol - Basic, Protocol-level BitTorrent Utilities

Synopsis
        use Net::BitTorrent::Protocol;
        # TODO

Functions
    In addition to the functions found in Net::BitTorrent::Protocol::BEP03,
    Net::BitTorrent::Protocol::BEP03::Bencode,
    Net::BitTorrent::Protocol::BEP06, Net::BitTorrent::Protocol::BEP07,
    Net::BitTorrent::Protocol::BEP10, Net::BitTorrent::Protocol::BEP23,
    TODO..., a function which wraps all the packet parsing functions is
    provided:

    `parse_packet( \$data )'
        Attempts to parse any known packet from the data (a scalar ref)
        passed to it. On success, the payload and type are returned and the
        packet is removed from the incoming data reference. `undef' is
        returned on failure and the data in the reference is unchanged.
